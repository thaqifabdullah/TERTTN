 IoT Data is routing through different service components :

\begin{enumerate}
 \item GateWay
 \item Router
 \item Broker
 \item Network Server
 \item Handler
\end{enumerate}

\begin{flushleft}
 There are 2 possible ways of connection :
\end{flushleft}
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Public Community Network (preferred options because hosted by TTN Foundation)
  \item Private Network
 \end{enumerate}

 \paragraph{The first step is to prepare the Development Environment for the backend.}The goal is to have our own private network.
 The instructions of this preparation are mentioned in the repository GitHub \url{https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/ttn}
\paragraph{Next step is to set up TTN's backend for development} There are some errors when running some tests from the make program.
